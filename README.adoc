What is this?
=============

This is the companion demo of the talk on "Building a Global Distributed Service Mesh" delivered at Red Hat Summit 2019.


How to set up the demo?
=======================

1. Create an OpenShift cluster in RHPDS.

2. Use the provisioning script to create projects and deploy AMQ Broker and AMQ interconnect for all three regions:

    ./provision-rhpds-ocp3.11.sh <UUID> <admin_user> <admin_password>

This will deploy the routers, the brokers and the applications.

3. Go to https://master00-UUID.generic.opentlc.com and verify that:

* all three of the following projects exist: `apac`, `emea`, `nam`
* each project has a broker, router and core-banking application

4. Open terminals for each of the end-user apps and start sending messages

* http://core-banking-apac.apps-<UUID>.generic.opentlc.com
* http://core-banking-emea.apps-<UUID>.generic.opentlc.com
* http://core-banking-nam.apps-<UUID>.generic.opentlc.com


How to set up the demo on OpenShift 4.3?
========================================

1. Create an OpenShift 4.3 cluster.

2. Use the provisioning script to create projects and deploy AMQ Broker and AMQ interconnect for all three regions:

    ./provision-ocp4.3.sh <domain> <admin_user> <admin_password>

domain = domain-name of the OpenShift cluster. Master_URL = https://api.<domain>:6443

This will deploy the routers, the brokers and the applications.

3. Go to OpenShift Console https://console-openshift-console.apps.<domain> and verify that:

* all three of the following projects exist: `apac`, `emea`, `nam`
* each project has a broker, router and core-banking application

4. Open terminals for each of the end-user apps and start sending messages

* http://core-banking-apac.apps.<domain>
* http://core-banking-emea.apps.<domain>
* http://core-banking-nam.apps.<domain>
